**Summary**
* This project focuses on developing and implementing Time Series Forecasting algorithms using machine learning techniques. By integrating real-time stock data, I aim to enhance the accuracy of stock price predictions. The key components of the project include:

* Algorithms Used: XGBoost and Bayesian Neural Networks (BNN) were utilized to create the predictive models.
* Prediction Scope: The models forecast stock prices for the upcoming seven days.
* Model Performance: A combined model approach, leveraging predictions from both XGBoost and BNN models, achieved an RMSE of ~0.0376.
* User Interfaces: Developed user-friendly interfaces using Next.js for web and Swift for iOS to provide seamless access to dynamic stock market predictions.
* This project showcases the effective combination of machine learning models and real-time data integration to deliver accurate and accessible stock price forecasts.

**Frontend**:
* Next.js: Used for developing user-friendly interfaces and dynamic web applications.
* SwiftUI: Utilized for developing responsive and interactive iOS applications.
* TypeScript: Used for statically typed JavaScript development, enhancing code quality and maintainability.
* TailwindCSS: Employed for efficient and customizable styling of UI components.

**Backend**:
* Flask: Used as a lightweight and flexible web framework for backend development.
* Node.js: Utilized for server-side scripting and building scalable network applications.

**Machine Learning**:
* XGBoost: Utilized for gradient boosting machine learning algorithms, particularly effective for regression and classification tasks.
* Pyro: Used for Bayesian probabilistic programming, enabling the implementation of Bayesian Neural Networks.
* Optuna: Employed for hyperparameter optimization, enhancing model performance and efficiency.
* pandas: Employed for data manipulation and analysis, facilitating efficient data preprocessing.
* Matplotlib: Used for data visualization and plotting, enabling clear representation of insights and findings.
